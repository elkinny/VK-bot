  <li><a href="http://es6-features.org/#Constants">ES6</a> - JavaScript has grown a lot in the past few years and lot of new features had been added to JavaScript to make it much more powerful and productive programming language</li>
  <li><a href="https://html5book.ru">HTML5</a> - the latest version of Hypertext Markup Language, the code that describes web pages. It's actually three kinds of code: HTML, which provides the structure; Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), which take care of presentation; and JavaScript, which makes things happen.</li>
  <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS3">CSS3</a> - the latest evolution of the Cascading Style Sheets language and aims at extending CSS2.1. It brings a lot of long-awaited novelties, like rounded corners, shadows, gradients, transitions or animations, as well as new layouts like multi-columns, flexible box or grid layouts. Experimental parts are vendor-prefixed and should either be avoided in production environments, or used with extreme caution as both their syntax and semantics can change in the future.</li>
  <li><a href="https://webpack.js.org">Webpack </a> - a static module bundler for modern JavaScript applications. When webpack processes your application, it internally builds a dependency graph which maps every module your project needs and generates one or more bundles.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_intro.asp">JQuery</a> - is a lightweight, "write less, do more", JavaScript library. The purpose of jQuery is to make it much easier to use JavaScript on your website. jQuery takes a lot of common tasks that require many lines of JavaScript code to accomplish, and wraps them into methods that you can call with a single line of code.</li>
